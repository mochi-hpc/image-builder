This repository is meant to build and push specific
environments to Mochi's Spack build cache. To build a new
environment and push it to the cache, simply edit the spack.yaml
file at the root of this repository. A GitHub action will be triggered.
This repository may only be used by members of the Mochi project.
PRs will be rejected. Forks will not work as they won't have
permissions to push to the cache.
